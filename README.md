üß™ An open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It's designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts.


**Scaffold-Eth 2 x Buildbear** lets you create your own private Sandbox, (optional)forked for various EVM and EVM-compatible blockchain networks, with your own Token faucet and blockchain explorer

# Key Features 

### 1. Creating your private testnet

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (v18 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2.git
cd scaffold-eth-2
yarn install
```

2. create your private Sandbox:

```
yarn fork-bb
```

This command allows you to create a BuildBear SandBox details are stored in `packages/buildbear/sandbox.json`

3. Deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys smart contracts to your BuildBear Sandbox. You can find the contracts in the packages/hardhat/contracts directory and modify them to fit your needs. The yarn deploy command utilizes the deploy script located in packages/hardhat/deploy to handle the deployment process on the network. This script is also customizable.

Please Note:
The `Aave` and `Swap` contracts leverage the Mainnet protocols within the sandbox. Currently, they are configured for the `Ethereum Mainnet` contract address. If you're creating your sandbox from a different chain, you'll need to provide the following:

- `pool` address in the `aave contract` for the corresponding chain [Aave contract address](https://docs.aave.com/developers/deployed-contracts/v3-mainnet)
- `SwapRouter` address in the `swap contract` for the corresponding chain [Uniswap contract address](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/deployments)

4. On a second terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

- Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend in `packages/nextjs/pages`
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

Please note that the `hardhat.config.ts` and `scaffold.config.ts` files are currently configured for BuildBear sandboxes. If you want to use a different network, you can set it as the default in these files.
